                        <p>Create and prototype a new Fintech concept to help Millennials
                            plan their personal investments and improve their finances, using the

                        <p>This project was done individually, so I conducted
                            research, created concepts & visual identity, prioritized ideas, 
                            defined UX and created & tested a prototype.

                    <p>Unity was a one week project that aimed to
                    create a concept to serve as a financial tool for
                    Millennials, so they could plan their personal
                    investments and improve their finances.</p>

                    <div class="process">
                        <h2>Process</h2>
                        <p>I followed the Design Sprint process to define
                            the product’s offering, understand user
                            needs, design & prioritise UX features, create
                            a visual language, create a narrative and
                            prototype the concept (Figma).
                            Literature showed that Millennials are
                            volunteering in record numbers, as well as
                            creating activism movements.
                            On the other hand, user research showed
                            that Millennials are more likely to achieve
                            goals when those are shared, such as fitness
                            goals.</p>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                    <div class="results">
                        <h2>Deliverable</h2>
                        <p>The final concept allowed Millennials to
                            create short and long term goals, launch
                            saving strategies and invest. Their savings
                            and investments will generate revenue,
                            Unity
                            and for every € they win, a social project of
                            their choice will receive a certain amount
                            of funding. They will be able to track the
                            progress of the funding for that project, from
                            start to end.
                            Also, users will be able to create collaborative
                            goals with friends or relatives, as well as
                            collaborative investments.</p>
