                                people, wherein my main responsibilities
                                were trend research, ideation, time
                                pacing strategy and roadmapping.

                        <p>Ultimaker is facing a knowledge gap within their target
                            group; potential users don't know how to 3D print and
                            what the possibilities are. Our project proposes a new
                            concept and strategy to prevent this problem, by involving
                            3D printing technology in educational stages prior to university.

                            <h2>Process</h2>
                            <p>We started the project conducting a 4C analysis; by analyzing the company,
                                the customers, the context and the competitors, we could spot a opportunity 
                                to work on and consequently improve Ultimaker's market position: Ultimaker's
                                target group don't know the full range of possibilities of 3D printing, in terms
                                of mass production or complex printing.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p>During the customer analysis we created a system architecture from the gathered
                                    customer journey, so we could detect the problem spotted previously in it. The
                                    boxes coloured in light blue indicate a knowledge gap within the respective stage.
                                </p>

                                We conducted a Creative Trend Research using 4 different techniques: Trend Views, 
                                Trend Scenarios, Trend Topics and Trend Patterns, which involved experts interviews,
                                 DEPEST and desk research. We created themes and used them during our ideation sessions.  
                                </p>

                                    After planning several ideation sessions, we defined the concept, created a future vision with a coherent
                                    storytelling, and we created a strategic roadmap in order to show the steps to achieve that vision.

                            <p>Ultimakers’ goal is to make 3D printing more accessible for a larger group
                                of enterprises. The problem now is that there is a knowledge gap for a
                                large group of people, they don’t know how to 3D print, what the possibilities
                                are, and what they can use it for. Combining the problem statement
                                and the trend analysis, a future vision was formulated: “All high school graduates
                                know the possibilities of 3D printing”.

                                During 3 horizons Ultimaker will
                                create educational materials about 3D printing for schools. These materials
                                will exist of challenges, focusing on the possibilities of 3D printing and
                                the student’s expertise, rather than focusing on working with specific CAD
                                programma’s in order to keep the content accessible for everyone.

                            <p>
                                To achieve this, Ultimaker will adapt
                                their software to new technologies such
                                as mixed reality and will partner up
                                with educational organisations to make
                                their content fit into school systems.
                            </p>

                                By letting kids get in touch with 3D
                                printing and the brand Ultimaker from
                                an early age, they will get used to using
                                the method in combination with the
                                Ultimaker brand which increases the
                                likelihood to use Ultimaker in a later
                                stage of life and in their future careers.
                                Eventually the knowledge gap will be
                                prevented and 3D printing will be the
                                way to express the new generations
                                creativity and their entrepreneurial
                                mindset.

                                and the trends over time, divided into 3 horizons.

                                We created a time-pacing strategy that fits Ultimaker's iteration speed, based on past innovations
                                of Ultimaker. It describes when products and services should be launched, and we encouraged
                                the company to speed up the software development process in order to realize the future vision and to
                                stay relevant.
